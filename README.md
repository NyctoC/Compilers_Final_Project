# Formal Languages & Compilers Final Project

## Group Members

* Cristian Cárdenas
* Isabella Marquez

## Environment

* **Operating System**: Windows 10/11, Ubuntu 22.04 (compatible with both)
* **Programming Language**: Python 3.10+
* **Editor/Tools Used**: VSCode, Python CLI

## Project Description

This project implements algorithms to compute First and Follow sets for context-free grammars, as well as LL(1) and SLR(1) parsers. The implementation follows the algorithms described in Aho et al., "Compilers: Principles, Techniques, and Tools" (2nd Edition), sections 4.4 and 4.6.

## Requirements

* Python 3.10 or higher installed

## Usage

Run the program from a terminal using Python:

```bash
python main.py
```

### Input Format:

The program reads input from standard input (stdin) in the following format:

1. First line: A number `n` representing the number of nonterminals in the grammar
2. Next `n` lines: Productions in the format `<nonterminal> -> <derivation alternatives separated by spaces>`

Example:
```
3
S -> S+T T
T -> T*F F
F -> (S) i
```

### Behavior:

The program determines if the grammar is LL(1), SLR(1), both, or neither:

1. If it is both **LL(1)** and **SLR(1)**:
   ```
   Select a parser (T: for LL(1), B: for SLR(1), Q: quit):
   ```
   The user can then input strings to parse until an empty line is given, then the prompt repeats.

2. If only **LL(1)**:
   ```
   Grammar is LL(1).
   ```
   The user can input strings to parse until an empty line is given.

3. If only **SLR(1)**:
   ```
   Grammar is SLR(1).
   ```
   The user can input strings to parse until an empty line is given.

4. If neither:
   ```
   Grammar is neither LL(1) nor SLR(1).
   ```

For cases 1, 2, and 3, the program prints `yes` when a given string is generated by the grammar and `no` otherwise.

## Notes

* The capital letter 'S' is always the initial symbol.
* Nonterminals are capital letters.
* Terminals are not upper-case letters.
* The empty string, ε, is represented by the letter `e`.
* Every string ends with `$`.
* The symbols `e` and `$` are not allowed as terminal symbols in the grammar.

## Implementation Details

The project consists of the following Python modules:

1. `grammar.py`: Defines the Grammar class to represent context-free grammars
2. `first_follow.py`: Implements algorithms to compute First and Follow sets
3. `ll_parser.py`: Implements the LL(1) parsing table construction and parsing algorithm
4. `slr_parser.py`: Implements the SLR(1) parsing table construction and parsing algorithm
5. `main.py`: Main program that handles input/output and coordinates the parsing process

## Examples

### Example 1:
```
3
S -> S+T T
T -> T*F F
F -> (S) i
```
Output: `Grammar is SLR(1).`

### Example 2:
```
3
S -> AB
A -> aA d
B -> bBc e
```
Output: `Select a parser (T: for LL(1), B: for SLR(1), Q: quit):`

### Example 3:
```
2
S -> A
A -> A b
```
Output: `Grammar is neither LL(1) nor SLR(1).`
